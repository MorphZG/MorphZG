**Zoran Topic**\
Since very early age i was interested in programming but since life can be
unpredictable, we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights,
fine music and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong!

True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was
boiling until it bursts in flames. Point of no return.
