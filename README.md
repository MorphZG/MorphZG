## Zoran Topic
Since very early age i was interested in programming but since life can be
unpredictable, we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights,
fine music and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong!\
True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was
boiling until it bursts in flames. Point of no return.

To make it clear. I am far from being expert or even advance knowledge with these technologies. I am very passionate about it.
Offten short on time, having a full time job as a bartender, those moments in front of screen with all tools loaded makes me
really excited. Python is my first love and programming language where i am most comfortable. I have solid knowledge about
fundamentals, practicing every single day. Even for a few minutes but i must type and code every day. I hope to find a job
this year and finaly prove that it's never late to pursue your dreams.

Alongside python, i am practicing git and backup some of my work with github. While practicing git through CLI i am also improving
my shell and linux knowledge. Got some books on bash scripting. Next step will be learning more about python frameworks like django
or flask and learn more about databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Started coding with PyCharm but it is more suitable for larger projects. I like to dig deeper and learn how things work, trying to
understand the process that PyCharm does automaticaly, with few mouse clicks. So i had to research new concepts like virtual environments,
dependancy management, git commands... I am big fan of command line so i had to find a tool with less features, a text editor.
Sublime-text and VIM are exactly what i need at this moment. VIM have steep learning curve but it feels like something special so i cant
let it go. All these tools are just tools and i use all of them while trying to write perfect .vimrc config file :D
