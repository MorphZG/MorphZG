# Zoran Topic

 Since very early age i was interested in programming but life is upredictable, we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights, fine music and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong! True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was boiling until it bursted in flames. Point of no return. ## Skills and interests ![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black) ![Shell Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell_script-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![Oracle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oracle-F80000?style=for-the-badge&logo=oracle&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) ![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/django-%23092E20.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white) 

Young, naive and overconfident. Now, 36 years of age, frustrated but highly motivated. I thought success will come by default but was wrong. I always felt confident with skills and value i offer to my employee. bartender since 2005 till now. and i was sure i am a good one. but after my 30 birthday i started to question. somehow i realized i have other skills and interests that none of my colleagues have. In more than a decade of my bartending None of my work buddies. few more years have passed and i am now sure i am different. i just don’t fit into the stereotype.

Started to wonder. who am i actually? my natural talent. some born as warriors, some as bards, musicians and others as clowns. Who am i? And i found the answer. What you do in your free time? That is career for you. Ever since high school technology was around me. While friends just play the games. I always tried to find how mechanics work? How damage is calculated? How to get highest value with minimal effort. And just like that my head bulb was lit. i love code, i love exploiting the system rules to get optimal results. never really a math guy but mechanics in the background.

When i started coding in visual studio i got access to simplified git interface. I had urge to learn how all those components work together. Launch the terminal and learn git, learn bash and linux scripting… like puzzles connecting and forming a picture. I realized the backend for web apps is my perfect fit. But then came machine learning and all those really challenging stuff years ahead of me. Currently to high above my level. With 36 i think i am now more than ready to take that bite.

To make it clear. I am far from being an expert. I am very passionate about it. Often short on time, having a full time job as a bartender, those moments in front of the screen with all tools loaded makes me really excited. Python is my first love and programming language where i am most comfortable. I enjoy doing coding challenges, practicing and learning every single day. I hope to find a job this year and finally prove that it's never late to pursue your dreams. Alongside python, i am practicing javascript, html and css as i see them as a fundamental web technologies. Web apps are probably the easiest entry through the rabbit hole, my cheapest ticket for the high class. Start with web than find another road, small secret passage to AI and machine learning. I am a big fan of command line, always trying to look behind the screen and cool graphics, learn how mechanics in the bacground operates, how and who pulls the strings.
