# Zoran Topic

Since very early age i was interested in programming but life is upredictable, we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights, fine music and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong! True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was boiling until it bursted in flames. Point of no return.

To make it clear. I am far from being expert with these technologies. I am very passionate about it. Often short on time, having a full time job as a bartender, those moments in front of the screen with all tools loaded makes me really excited. Python is my first love and programming language where i am most comfortable. I enjoy doing coding challanges, practicing and learning every single day. I hope to find a job this year and finaly prove that it's never late to pursue your dreams. Alongside python, i am practicing git and backup some of my work with github. I am big fan of command line, always trying to look behind the surface and learn how things operate in the background. That is one of the reasons my environment is running on linux so along the way i am learning about the shell scripting also. As someone who is backend oriented i have basic knowledge of SQL. Next step will be to dive deeper and learn more about database management systems like Postgresql or MySQL.
