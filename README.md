# Zoran Topic

Since very early age i was interested in programming but life is upredictable, we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights, fine music and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong! True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was boiling until it bursts in flames. Point of no return.

To make it clear. I am far from being expert with these technologies. I am very passionate about it. Offten short on time, having a full time job as a bartender, those moments in front of the screen with all tools loaded makes me really excited. Python is my first love and programming language where i am most comfortable. I enjoy doing coding challanges, practicing and learning every single day. I hope to find a job this year and finaly prove that it's never late to pursue your dreams. Alongside python, i am practicing git and backup some of my work with github. I am big fan of command line, always trying to look behind the surface and learn how things work in the background. That is the main reason my dev environment is running on linux. Learning about bash scripting along the way. Next step will be learning more about python web frameworks like django or flask, learn more about databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
